"# bank-churn-bivariate" 
This is an analysis of bank churning data, and I performed a bivariate analysis on this data to get insights. And I got insights like gender and country together give more value for the churners.
As you check the insights you will get to know that 
Female + Germany has the highest churn ratio when compared to all others.
